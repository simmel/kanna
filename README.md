## kanna

A small shim on top of
[camel-blueprint-main](https://github.com/apache/camel-karaf/tree/master/components/camel-blueprint-main)
which runs your [OSGi Blueprints](https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/service.blueprint.html)
in sort of the same way that [Apache Karaf](https://karaf.apache.org) does and
with logging enabled via [logback](https://logback.qos.ch/).

### Caveats

* No uberjar, only distTar

### Usage

1. FIXME

### TODO

* [ ] Investigate how to be used as uberjar
* [ ] Be able to set bundle version?
